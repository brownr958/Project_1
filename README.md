#  Exxoplanet Analysis

 Looking up into the night sky puts things into perspective of how special or perhaps isifnificant we are on our little planet. We wanted to see for ourselves what NASA has been doing to answer this question on just how unique pur planet is. NASA has been interested in this for a long time and has several resources arond the world looking costantly into space finding earth like planets and recording them. So lets look and see what some of the most special and most intelligent people have uncovered so far. 
 
# Accomplishing the Task

The first think that needed to be done was to find a great source of information on the exoplanets and of course NASA has a database on relevant exoplanets. There is over 4000 planets and over 200 columns of information, so pretty substantial. Unfortunately the first time this code was written so the original data was not usable but, after some changes is usable again.

This table was taken and transformed into a csv and loaded into a jupyter notebook for the manipulation of the data.

The data was then trimmed down later to be used to detrmine what sort of facilties were most active, had the most discoveries, and what years were the most productive. To determine how similiar these planets were to earth we had to reduce the data down to what was relvant to another table we found that had an earth similiarity index.

Once the tables had been merged, and the writing of some conditionals, we determined a couple other planets from the main nasa database that could be considered as well.

Lastly we made some simple graphs that showed correlations of planets from the  PSL database and some other factors  present in the main NASA database.
